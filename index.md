### Comments from Students - Group work

<br>

*Groups worked well although they were somewhat random, maybe having a chance to form
groups on the first day instead of having them pre-determined would have worked better*

<br>

*The groupwork worked pretty well! The first contract at the beginning of the course
felt a bit strange but was very nice to have as a backup! Though there were some
communciation issues within our group, in general the teamwork went great and we
really bonded together! I think I have made some friends for life here :)*

<br>

*Cooperation worked well in the end, during the course there were some difficulties,
but we got through it. I think that one of the problems was that a lot of things were
new for us Erasmus students so it was hard to do time management and adjust the
scope of the project accordingly*

---

### Comments from Students - Learning Environment

<br>

*There was a very nice and a bit more informal setting that worked really well for
inviting me to ask questions or feel appreciated for my input. In general all teachers
were really positive about everything and that kept us going even if we were more
insecure.*

<br>

*I felt very welcome to learn and I think the environment was very open and welcom-
ing in general! Thanks for that :)*

---

### Comments from Students - Project-based Learning

<br>

*The main project and excitement building up to the final presentations was really
nice and good to have*

<br>

*I very much liked the theme of the course, the open nature of the projects and the
amount of resources that were available to us.*

<br>

*I like the project assignment system a lot*

<br>

*Everything was very well communicated and the Canvas page for this course worked
a lot better than for some of my other courses :)*

---

### Comments from Students - A Memorable Experience

<br>

*I think I have made some friends for life here :)*

<br>

*This has been the most inclusive course I’ve ever taken at Chalmers! All to-dos on diversity and inclusion have made me think and reflect on problems I knew nothing about before. Include that to everyone*

<br>

*I had a lot of fun during this course, I also learned a lot and really feel like this was
a course that made my exchange semester more meaningful!*
